Introduction
============

This library is a work in progress dedicated to storing FRFs with similar
sampling frequency and time window. For now it's only built for storing
processed FRFs into numpy arrays with a few extra information alongside them.
It also includes tools for building certain geometries in ANSYS and get their
FRFs. This is still a very early alpha, but the main objective of this project
is to comfortably have FRFs for training deep learning models with ease.

The basic syntax is not that different from Markdown, but it also
has many more powerful features that Markdown doesn't have. We aren't
taking advantage of those yet though.

- Bullet points
- Are intuitive
- And simple too
